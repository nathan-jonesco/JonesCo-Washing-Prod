# Our Story

At **JonesCo Window and Pressure Washing**, we are more than just a business; we are a family deeply committed to serving our community with integrity, hard work, and faith. Our story is one of dedication, love, and a passion for excellence that has been passed down through generations.

## Meet the Jones Family

The driving force behind JonesCo Window and Pressure Washing is the Jones family, led by **Johnathan Jones** and **Nathan Jones**—two brothers who have dedicated their lives to making a difference in their community.

**Johnathan Jones** has always had a knack for working with his hands. For many years, he was a skilled mechanic, known for his ability to fix just about anything. But Johnathan's journey didn't stop there. He felt a calling to do more for his community and decided to go back to school, where he earned a degree in nursing. Johnathan served as a compassionate nurse for several years, providing care and support to countless patients. However, his love for hands-on work never faded, and he eventually transitioned into a full-time role as an Exterior Home Maintenance Master. Today, Johnathan leads our operations with a focus on efficiency and quality, ensuring that every job is done right the first time.

**Nathan Jones** took a different path. With a passion for technology, he pursued a career in the tech field and quickly rose through the ranks to become a Director of Technology. Nathan's expertise in tech, sales, marketing, and HR has been instrumental in the growth and success of JonesCo Window and Pressure Washing. While Johnathan focuses on the day-to-day operations, Nathan ensures that our business is always at the forefront of innovation and customer service.

Together, Johnathan and Nathan have built a business that reflects their shared values of hard work, honesty, and a commitment to excellence. But their story wouldn't be complete without their families by their side.

## Our Supportive Families

Behind every successful business are the people who support and inspire it. For the Jones brothers, that support comes from their loving wives and children.

**Nathan's wife, Haley Jones**, is a dedicated local nurse who shares her husband's commitment to helping others. Her compassion and care for her patients mirror the values that drive JonesCo Window and Pressure Washing. **Johnathan's wife** has taken on the important role of a stay-at-home mom, but her background as a social worker and recruiter has given her invaluable experience in understanding and supporting the needs of others. Together, they have three wonderful children—**Nathan Jones, Harper Jones, and Maggie Jones**—who are learning the importance of community and hard work from a young age.

## Our Faith and Community

At the heart of everything we do is our Baptist faith. We are proud members of our local church, where we find strength, guidance, and a sense of belonging. Our faith plays a central role in our lives and our business, inspiring us to treat every customer with the respect, honesty, and care that aligns with our values.
