# Our Story

At **JonesCo Window and Pressure Washing**, we are more than just a business; we are a family deeply committed to serving our community with integrity, hard work, and faith. Our story is one of dedication, love, and a passion for excellence that has been passed down through generations.

## Meet the Jones Family

The driving force behind JonesCo Window and Pressure Washing is the Jones family, led by **Johnathan Jones** and **Nathan Jones**—a father and son duo whose dedication to their craft and community has set them apart in the industry.

**Johnathan Jones** has always had a knack for working with his hands. For many years, he was a skilled mechanic, known for his ability to fix just about anything. But Johnathan's journey didn't stop there. Feeling a deeper calling to serve his community, he went back to school and earned a degree in nursing. Johnathan served as a compassionate nurse for several years, providing care and support to countless patients. However, his love for hands-on work never faded, and he eventually transitioned into a full-time role as an Exterior Home Maintenance Master. Today, Johnathan leads our operations with a focus on efficiency and quality, ensuring that every job is done right the first time.

**Nathan Jones** took a different path. With a passion for technology, he pursued a career in the tech field and quickly rose through the ranks to become a Director of Technology. Nathan's expertise in tech, sales, marketing, and HR has been instrumental in the growth and success of JonesCo Window and Pressure Washing. While Johnathan focuses on the day-to-day operations, Nathan ensures that our business is always at the forefront of innovation and customer service.

Together, Johnathan and Nathan have built a business that reflects their shared values of hard work, honesty, and a commitment to excellence. But their story wouldn't be complete without their families by their side.

## Our Supportive Families

Behind every successful business are the people who support and inspire it. For the Jones family, that support comes from their loving wives, **Haley Jones** and **Jennifer Jones**, who have been the backbone of the business, offering unwavering support and encouragement.

**Haley Jones**, Nathan’s wife, is a dedicated local nurse whose compassion and care for her patients is mirrored in the way she supports her family and their business. Her work as a nurse, a role that demands patience, empathy, and resilience, is a testament to her strength and character. Haley's ability to balance her demanding career with her role as a wife and dog mom is nothing short of extraordinary, and without her, the business wouldn’t be where it is today.

**Jennifer Jones**, Johnathan’s wife, is a remarkable woman who has worn many hats throughout her life. From being a social worker to a recruiter, Jennifer has always been dedicated to helping others. Now, as a stay-at-home mom, she continues to support her family with the same level of dedication and love. Her experience in social work has given her a deep understanding of the importance of community and support, values that are reflected in the way JonesCo Window and Pressure Washing operates. Jennifer's contributions to the family business are immeasurable, and her ability to nurture and support her family is the foundation upon which their success is built.

Together, **Nathan Jones**, **Harper Jones**, and **Maggie Jones**, the children of Johnathan and Jennifer, are growing up with the same values of hard work, community service, and faith that have guided the Jones family for generations. They are learning from the best, and one day, they too will carry forward the legacy of JonesCo Window and Pressure Washing.
