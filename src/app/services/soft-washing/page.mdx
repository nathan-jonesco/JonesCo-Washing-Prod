# Professional Soft Washing

Soft washing is a highly effective cleaning method that uses low pressure and specialized solutions to safely remove dirt, algae, mold, and mildew from the exterior of your home or business. At **JonesCo Window and Pressure Washing**, we specialize in providing professional soft washing services that protect your property while enhancing its appearance.

## Protects Your Property

Unlike traditional pressure washing, soft washing uses a gentle approach that prevents damage to delicate surfaces like siding, roofing, and windows. This method is ideal for cleaning materials that might be harmed by high-pressure washing, ensuring your property remains in excellent condition.

## Eliminates Harmful Contaminants

Soft washing effectively removes harmful contaminants such as mold, mildew, algae, and bacteria that can cause health problems and degrade building materials. By eliminating these contaminants, you can prevent costly repairs and maintain a healthier living or working environment.

## Enhances Curb Appeal

A clean exterior makes a lasting impression on visitors, customers, and potential buyers. Soft washing restores the original beauty of your home or business, making it look fresh and well-maintained. This improved curb appeal can significantly increase the value of your property.

## Extends the Life of Surfaces

Over time, dirt, algae, and other pollutants can cause damage to your exterior surfaces, leading to premature aging and deterioration. Soft washing helps extend the lifespan of these surfaces by removing harmful substances that contribute to wear and tear, saving you money on repairs and replacements.

## Understanding the Soft Washing Process

Soft washing is more than just a gentler version of pressure washing—it's a comprehensive cleaning process that involves specialized techniques and solutions. Here's a closer look at how soft washing works:

### 1. **Low-Pressure Application**
The key to soft washing is the use of low pressure, which is typically less than 500 PSI (pounds per square inch). This low pressure ensures that surfaces are cleaned without the risk of damage that high-pressure methods can cause. It’s particularly beneficial for delicate materials like vinyl siding, stucco, and shingles.

### 2. **Specialized Cleaning Solutions**
Soft washing relies on eco-friendly cleaning solutions that are designed to break down dirt, algae, mold, and other contaminants at their source. These solutions are applied to the surface and allowed to dwell for a specific period, ensuring that all unwanted growths and stains are thoroughly treated.

### 3. **Rinse and Protect**
After the cleaning solution has done its job, the area is gently rinsed with water, leaving your surfaces clean and residue-free. In some cases, protective treatments can be applied to help prevent future growth of mold and algae, keeping your property looking its best for longer.

## Ideal Surfaces for Soft Washing

Soft washing is the preferred cleaning method for a variety of surfaces around your home or business. Here are some of the areas where soft washing excels:

### 1. **Roofing**
Asphalt shingles, tile, and metal roofs can all benefit from soft washing. High-pressure washing can dislodge shingles or cause granules to come off, leading to premature wear. Soft washing removes moss, algae, and lichen without harming the roofing material.

### 2. **Siding**
Whether your home has vinyl, wood, or fiber cement siding, soft washing is gentle enough to clean without stripping paint or damaging the surface. This method effectively removes stains and buildup, keeping your siding looking new.

### 3. **Stucco and Brick**
These surfaces are porous and can trap dirt, mold, and mildew. Soft washing penetrates deep into these materials to remove contaminants, preventing staining and deterioration.

### 4. **Fences**
Wooden and vinyl fences are prone to algae and mildew growth, especially in shaded areas. Soft washing cleans these surfaces thoroughly, helping to maintain the integrity and appearance of your fencing.

### 5. **Patios and Decks**
Wooden decks and stone patios can be cleaned without the risk of splintering or etching when soft washing is used. This process removes dirt and organic growth, extending the life of your outdoor spaces.

## Benefits of Regular Soft Washing

Maintaining a regular soft washing schedule offers several long-term benefits for your property:

### 1. **Preserve Property Value**
A well-maintained exterior contributes significantly to your property's overall value. Regular soft washing ensures that your home or business maintains its appeal and structural integrity, which is crucial if you're considering selling or refinancing.

### 2. **Prevent Costly Repairs**
By removing harmful contaminants early, soft washing helps prevent the kind of damage that can lead to expensive repairs. Mold, mildew, and algae can cause rot, decay, and structural issues if left untreated.

### 3. **Healthier Living Environment**
Mold and mildew aren't just unsightly—they can also pose health risks, particularly for individuals with allergies or respiratory issues. Soft washing removes these allergens from your home's exterior, contributing to a healthier living environment.

## How Often Should You Soft Wash?

The frequency of soft washing depends on various factors, including your location, the surrounding environment, and the materials of your exterior surfaces. Generally, it’s recommended to schedule a soft washing service every 1 to 3 years. Homes in humid or heavily shaded areas may require more frequent cleaning due to the rapid growth of algae and mold.
